A discord bot made primarily with Node.js and Eris, with plans to constantly add commands and grow to new platforms.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you started using the bot and making sure it is set up well on your server. If you are having issues with the bot, be sure to check over these steps again or join the support server.

### Prerequisites

To add the bot to your server, you need to meet at least one of the following requirements:

* Be the owner of the server
* Have "Manage Server" permission on the server

For the bot to work properly, it will need all of the permissions seen in the below image.

You can [click here](https://goo.gl/ktrEbN) for an invite that has these permissions pre-selected for you.

### Using the bot

The prefix to use the bot is `pls` *Example: pls ping*. No, not `!`, `?`, or `-` like most bots. Prefixes don't have to be a common symbol!

To get the full command list, you can do `pls help`.

![pls help example](http://i.imgur.com/nMcOsHM.gif "Help me Melmsiwan-Kenobi, you're my only hope!")

All commands use the same prefix, and are updated constantly!

If you need any more help with anything, join [this server](https://discord.gg/3GNMJBG)!

## Self hosting the bot

We do not support or encourage self hosting of this bot. The code is here for learning and transparency purposes.

As long as you follow the license, we don't care if you host your own version of Dank Memer. However, we will not be taking the time to help set it up.
